So there is a great need for instilling a notion of design philosophy among all the engineers responsible for developing the application (in our case it’s an enterprise wide behemoth platform), thereby creating and sharing a design ethos. The problem we started to face is creating a coherent, unified language which can scale across devices - not just beauty and aesthetics. So we decided in designing a strategic platform with evidence and research based design.As a baby step we started to focus on the components first, and then combine those to build larger components that eventually make up for a bigger ecosystem. Easier being said, actually, it really is a more daunting and fragile exercise in conducting the research. So we’ve conducted research starting with the building and foundational components .This talk discusses about the research we created and bring substantial impact for the design we have created.",

Moreover, it means believing that the people who face those problems every day are the ones who hold the key to their answer. This design process offers problem solvers of any stripe a chance to design with communities, to deeply understand the people they’re looking to serve, to dream up scores of ideas, and to create innovative new solutions rooted in people’s actual needs.

Our tools are getting smarter, data is influencing our process and the user is often our co-creator. All of this changes how we approach the craft of design.All designers, engineers and product managers strive towards great product experiences. But what does that really mean in a fast-paced custom development environment? And is there an established method for complex organizations to achieve that goal and to drive innovation within the constraints of time and budget? Constraints need not be suffocating. They don’t always make your lives easier, but embracing them can lead to new paths and surprise us (in a good way). At SAP Custom Development, customer requirements generally dictate creation of custom UI.

As a woman entrepreneur, in India, at an early age of 29, it was the perfect journey! Start a business with a confidence in yourself, with the people you trust & love working with, and customers who chose to work with ‘you’, and extensive support from the family! A business that is profitable from day 1, and grows into a few million dollars in less than 5 years! A team that you built - choosing one at a time- like one Lego block after another! That might sound attractive, and the perfect spot to be at the zenith of success. Kick back and enjoy the fruits of the seeds you sowed.But then I started getting restless. Started feeling guilty about my restlessness – when I should have been grateful that all the hard work paid off! I started thinking about retiring and being a full time mom at the age of 35! Have you ever felt that way? Restlessness is not negative. Instead, I viewed it as a sign - Probably it was time to move on and start something else…I realized that it wasn’t so much about the money I enjoyed, as it was about the challenge. I was reluctant to stay on-board for the easy part, preferring to hand off the well-established ‘product’ and start over again. For most entrepreneurs, starting and running one successful business during their career is enough of a challenge. A friend once asked me, while our kids were playing in the park, ‘how can do it all over again’?....I looked at her three adorable kids playing with my son, and asked her in return, - ‘how can you do it all over again’? And we just started laughing! It is hard to quantify and qualify how much of the soul is exchanged for bringing a company to life, having other families depend on you; and a ‘one-time transaction’ is enough. It takes a special breed of people to explore into the wilderness of business startup. And it takes an even more driven person to start & enjoy business after business. I am an extremely emotional person, so it takes immense personal resources and hard work to make logical decisions and take calculated risk! And yet here I am – an entrepreneur the second time, exploring the thrill of a startup life once again! Honestly, it’s quite appealing to do it only once. Having executed successfully in the past, it has sharpened my vision for the upcoming future. This future will be very different from the past; and I learnt from the mistakes, the information, the techniques and the experiences. Failure does not scare me or stop me. However, I am afraid of regret. I don’t want to look back on my life and keep wondering ‘what if’. For our breed, failure is not a choice, but each failure is one more lesson to get it correct. There is this sense of joy and pride of living in the moment. I realized that I needed to keep trying, push myself and experience new things. Being a good listener, accepting feedback and seeking guidance from people I respected, helped.We are admired for our pluck and tenacity. Setbacks are inevitable. And we have the courage and the humility to fix them. An innate knack to dispel the destructive thoughts, which could plague a less resilient soul with self-doubt and uncertainty, is what sets our breed apart. Our beliefs are informed by our experiences. We tend to come back to those fundamental traits. We keep thinking ‘God, I am not going to do this again’; and we always do! One easy decision leads to the next, and business crops up serendipitously. It’s like having clear ‘entry’ and ‘exit’ signs posted along the way.Every morning I wake up to the challenge of the ‘knowing there will be unknowns’! I am far away from being one of those ‘serial’ entrepreneurs, and this is just one step on that exciting journey.",

The modern impression of Design is to lend itself to solving problems confronting the human race today both in the urban and rural context.

Can we attempt to bring about systemic change through the methods we developed as designers?Pick up any of the Sustainable Development Goals, and you realise the huge potential design has in addressing them. Design is the keyword, not who does it. As one gets exposed to Design Thinking and Human Centred Design as a way of problem solving, one realises the immense value in addressing wicked problems and deal with complexities in an ever evolving world. The challenge being that there is no one problem in such a context. Addressing them becomes tougher and leaders need to be prepared for it.Today Design is more about ‘Design for Need’ rather than ‘Design for Want’.
